There are many ways to keep track of what you are reading, but in this class you will use four inquiry prompts to organize your ideas around a particular text. It is important that you take notes on all the reading assignment assigned so you are able to participate fully in class discussion and complete assignments accurately. 

# **Inquiry Prompts** #

#### **WBS - *What is being said?*** ####
This is when you identify what the author is trying to say literally. There is no interpretation needed.

>They had walked in single file down the path, and even in the open one stayed behind the other. <span style="border-bottom:2px solid yellow;"> Both were dressed in denim trousers and in denim coats with brass buttons. Both wore black,</span> <span style="border-bottom:2px solid red;">shapeless hats</span> <span style="border-bottom:2px solid yellow;"> and both carried tight blanket rolls slung over their shoulders.</span> The first man was small and quick, dark of face, with restless eyes and sharp, strong features. Every part of him was defined: small, strong hands, slender arms, a thin and bony nose. <span style="border-bottom:2px solid green;">Behind him walked his opposite, a huge man, shapeless of face, with large, pale eyes, and wide, sloping shoulders; and he walked heavily, dragging his feet a little, the way a bear drags his paws. His arms did not swing at his sides, but hung loosely.</span>

*<span style="border-bottom:2px solid yellow;">underline yellow:</span>* **WBS**
\- The author shows the reader that there are two men walking down a path that are dressed alike. One is big and the other is small.

*<span style="border-bottom:2px solid red;">underline red:</span>* **CI**
\- What does a shapeless hat look like?

*<span style="border-bottom:2px solid green;">underline green:</span>* **II&SI** 
\- This reminds me of California miners that often wore.
\- Although they walked in a file and one man is bigger than	the other,	it appears that	the smaller guys is.

|Literal | Interpretative|
| :--- | :----: |
|The author shows the reader that there are two men walking down a path that are dressed alike. One is big and the other is small. | The author gives many descriptions of two men with faint human features. They are walking down path together appear to be more animal like than human. One is big like a bear and may be the stronger one. |

It is important to know exactly what is happening in a text before begin to understand its meaning. This is why this note taking strategy calls for the literal meaning and not the interpretative one. 

#### **II - *Interesting Ideas*** ####
This is an idea that is intriguing for any reason at all. Usually one might find an idea to be interesting if it connects to another story, event, or something that he/she has experienced. (**<span style="border-bottom:2px solid black;">Example Presented Above</span>**)

#### **SI - *Significant Ideas*** ####
This is an idea that connects to what may be the big idea. (The point of the text) This idea builds on the author’s main point.(**<span style="border-bottom:2px solid black;">Example Presented Above</span>**)

#### **CI - *Confusing Ideas*** ####
This is an idea that is not clear, confusing, or displayed in a way the reader in not accustomed to seeing. Vocabulary that is unclear or used differently can be confusing. Dates, events, and actions of characters can be confusing. New or contradicting ideas can be confusing.(**<span style="border-bottom:2px solid black;">Example Presented Above</span>**)

\* When taking notes, you need to identify the WBS for **<span style="border-bottom:2px solid black;">each paragraph</span>** and the inquiry prompts (CI, II, and SI) **<span style="border-bottom:2px solid black;">for each page</span>**. You should also underline and add a one-sentence note that explains each CI, II, and SI). If there isn’t any room to write this information your handout use a post-it note to write your notes.
